# Project Overview

This Face Re-Identification project combines state-of-the-art face detection and recognition technologies to provide real-time face identification capabilities. The system uses SCRFD (Sample and Computation Redistribution for Efficient Face Detection) for face detection and ArcFace for face recognition.

## Key Features

- **Real-time Face Detection**: Using SCRFD models optimized for different performance/accuracy tradeoffs
- **Accurate Face Recognition**: Implemented with ArcFace using ResNet-50 or MobileFace backbones
- **Multiple Model Options**: Support for various model sizes to suit different performance requirements
- **Video and Webcam Support**: Process both video files and real-time webcam feeds
- **Visualization Tools**: Built-in tools for visualizing detection and recognition results
- **Face Database Management**: Efficient storage and retrieval of face embeddings
- **Logging System**: Comprehensive logging capabilities for debugging and monitoring

## System Architecture

The system consists of these main components:

1. **Face Detection (SCRFD)**
   - Detects faces in input frames
   - Provides face bounding boxes and key points
   - Multiple model variants available (500M, 2.5G, 10G)

2. **Face Recognition (ArcFace)**
   - Extracts face embeddings for recognition
   - Computes similarity between faces
   - Supports different backbones (ResNet-50, MobileFace)

3. **Face Database**
   - FAISS-based similarity search
   - Efficient storage of face embeddings
   - Metadata management for face identities

4. **Utilities**
   - Image preprocessing and postprocessing
   - Visualization tools
   - Helper functions for geometry and mathematics
   - Configurable logging system
